# Send2Mars

A chrome plugin for populating a mobile app ID into the Veracode MARS app for upload.

Once added to Chrome first login to the MARS app, then simply do a [Google](https://www.google.com) search for an app on either the iTunes or Google Play store. You'll see a link every app page that says "send to:" and the Veracode logo. That link will take you to Mars, pop up the modal window, and pre-populate the ID field. From there click Upload to start the scan process.

## Available in the Chrome store
