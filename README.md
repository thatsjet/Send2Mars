# Send2Mars
### iOS only for now

A chrome plugin for fetching the Apple Store ID for a mobile application and popping into the Veracode MARS app for upload.

To use, unzip the contents, enable developer mode in Chrome, and add unpacked extension.

Once added to Chrome first login to the MARS app, then simply do a [Google](https://www.google.com) search for an iOS app on the iTunes store. You'll see a link on every app page in the iTunes store that says "send to:" and the Veracode logo. That link will take you to Mars, pop up the iOS modal window, and pre-populate the ID field. From there click Upload to start the scan process.
