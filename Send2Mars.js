/*
 here's how this needs to work

 - get the location of the current page
 - load contents of MARS window via js?
 - update text of IOS form and set UI hide css for that ui component
 - click upload

 ALTERNATIVELY
 - a chrome extension
 - inject a js into the MARS app
    * search itunes field
    * open new window/tab with search results
    * change input to grabID button after search
    * grabID gets the URL of the related iTunes page
